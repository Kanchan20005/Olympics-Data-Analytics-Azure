# Olympics-Data-Analytics-Azure
This is an end to end data engineering project on Azure portal with the use of Kaggle data (Olympic Data Analytics).The tools used here are Azure Data Factory, Data Lake Gen 2, Synapse Analytics, and Azure Databricks.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end data pipeline that integrates with different CSV files stored in this github repository. We load the data into the Azure Data Factory and transform the data using Databricks using Spark. Then the data is finally loaded into the Azure Data Lake Gen 2. Also, the data is analyzed using Azure Synapse Analysis and visualized using Power BI.

The project consists of several components, including data extraction/ingestion, transformation, data loading, data analysis, and finally data visualization.
